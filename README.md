Implementation of HATEOAS web design

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of the REST application architecture. A hypermedia-driven site provides information to navigate the site's REST interfaces dynamically by including hypermedia links with the responses.

In other words HATEOAS is a web design in which each response provides the answer to, “What can I do next?”
